## Usage
- Open Sublime Text 2  
- Go to Preferences/Browse Packages  
- Create a SuperCollider directory.  
- Copy and paste all the files from this repository in it.  
- Change Supercollider path in SuperCollider.sublime-settings
- Restart Sublime Text 2  
- In Tools, there is a new Supercollider sub menu which allows you to :
  - start and stop sclang, 
  - evaluate a line (ctrl+enter), 
  - stop all sounds (ctrl+.), 
  - and show/hide the console.  
- If your line starts with the character '(', it should evaluate the whole expression. But it does not work right now. Sorry.  

## Known bugs
